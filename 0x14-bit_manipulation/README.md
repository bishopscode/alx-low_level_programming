# BIT MANIPULATION
In this task, I delved into  manipulating bits and the use of bitwise operators >>, <<, &, |, and ^ in C.
Bit manipulation in C is the modification of individual bits within a memory location stored as a variable in the C programming language. Bit manipulation is performed by using bitwise operations such as bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and shift operations. This technique is used to manipulate flags, control specific bits within a memory location, and to set or clear individual bits. Bit manipulation can also be used to optimize code, particularly in systems programming or low-level programming.
